In a cafe just a little down the stairs
From a city shop selling cameras and things
I smelled your lighter oil mixed with coffee and cream
An odor still lingered from the lines you gave me
You said it, didn't you? "Just do it, kill me"

Today is a day that in particular
I seem to be smiling and laughing quite a lot
I just had a dream and in it you had died
And I had no choice then but to love you
Don't think to abandon or ever leave me

So wash me, cut me, I'm underwater
My lungs and breathing are quite affected
Please watch me closely and do check to see
I dry out completely, I dry through and through
Come shine me, tear me, I'm underwater
Relying completely on zero gravity
And when I do melt down entirely
Immediately, bon appetit

It was you who was dying there right in front of me
And I couldn't stop the tears, I couldn't hold them in
All of the little things of this little world
Are so very dear to me, it hurts to think of them
Oh, don't make me have those kind of dreams again

A scent so sweet that it got me dirty
The troops to protect me were out on patrol
Please watch me closely and do check to see
I dry out completely, I dry through and through
A lie so big that it got me dirty
As soon as I said it, a wound opened up
And when I do melt down entirely
Immediately, bon appetit

You said it, didn't you? "Just do it, kill me"

So wash me, cut me, I'm underwater
My lungs and breathing are quite affected
Please watch me closely and do check to see
I dry out completely, I dry through and through
Come shine me, tear me, I'm underwater
Relying completely on zero gravity
And when I do melt down entirely
Immediately, bon appetit

I'm not afraid of a little boredom
Why did the two of them ever chance to meet?
I'm not afraid of a little boredom
Why did the two of them ever chance to meet?
I'm not afraid...
